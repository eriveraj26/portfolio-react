                            When I started at University of Central Florida in Fall 2017, I was having a hard time deciding between a Music Performance degree and a STEM degree; I decided to go with Music Performance. During the process of meeting the music degree requirements, I also took courses in finance, accounting, and other disciplines--both related and not--and partook in both political office and non-profit internships. I have graduated from UCF with a degree in Integrated General Studies and a double minor in Music and Business, a combination which I believe best showcases what I have learned in my time at UCF.

            <h1>Intro to Sociology, SYG 2000</h1>
            <p>
                A GEP Course that had a big impact on my worldview was Intro to Sociology. The topic that stuck the most with me since then is the way that people associate and disassociate from others. Learning about the limitations of the phrase “birds of a feather flock together,” and on a different level, the determining factors of differing and sometimes opposing identities in a single person demonstrated to me just how complex people really are. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Frankly, however, the course content was the least of my experience with this course. I was having difficulty with the course and the professor, and I went to the professor seeking tips on improving my performance, and got around to asking about her research on geriatric patients in nursing homes, which I had been apprised of by her CV. To my immense surprise, she asked if I was interested in helping her with research; and to my latent disappointment, I didn’t accept the offer. In the moment, I did not realize what an incredibly opportunity this would have been. In the subsequent days, months, and semesters, it dawned on me that opportunities come to those stay engaged.

            <h1>Intro to Philosophy, PHI 2010H</h1>
            <p>
                Another GEP course that influenced me greatly was Intro to Philosophy. This course was important to my growth because of how poorly I performed. In spite of it being an introductory course to the topic, I truly had a difficult time comprehending the readings. All I remember was how incredibly dense I found every text, especially when it came to early philosophers, and how because I was having such a hard time at the beginning, I gradually started putting less and less effort into the course. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In reflecting on my experience in this course, it had occurred to me that I had made a habit of poking around difficult subjects to find the easiest way to learn them instead of leaning in and pushing myself to truly master the material. I remember some incredibly vague concepts, like the Platonic “thing” that we strive to create but never manage to replicate, and the idea that originally, nihilism is the belief that what matters is strictly what we put out into the world, but what’s stuck with me the most, and only upon reflection, is that in order to maximize the benefit of partaking in an experience, you have to lean in.

            <h1>Fundamentals of Oral Communication, SPC 1608H</h1>
            <p>
                A GEP course in which I successfully leaned in was Fundamentals of Oral Communication, which surprisingly enough I took earlier than the Philosophy class. This course was taught as a service-learning course, and I chose to work with the Florida Symphony Youth Orchestra, or the FYSO. I am an alumnus of the FSYO, and am very passionate about their role in Central Florida as a leading provider of excellent music education. This class was important to me because it allowed me to take something I was already passionate about and leverage it to work on my public speaking skills. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In hindsight, this was likely one of the most effective courses I have taken in my time at UCF. I left the course feeling like I could, in fact, become a director of some organization or other and not feel ill-prepared to deliver the message I needed to share. Combining passion or interest with new content, especially content as broad as speech delivery, is something that this speech course proved to me to be very effective.

                Theatre for Social Change, THE 4543H</h1>
            <p>
                I took this course in the fateful Spring of 2020. This course was a course I need to take in this specific semester. The course, in general, was about connecting people through the power of theatre, and by its very nature, was extremely emotionally difficult. That class triggered some of the strongest emotions, positive and negative, that I had felt in a long time. As far as material is concerned, I learned how to break the ice in a large group of strangers, run a workshop, run a classroom for short periods of time in different kinds of activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                A big takeaway from this course was that everybody has something. There were certain conversations that I found very difficult that others may not have; in the same way, there were instances where conversations or activities didn't cause me to feel strongly where it caused another person to need to take a pause from the activity. Even more than that, I learned the importance of building bridges to your fellow people and that if everyone in a room shares a vision, the execution will take care of itself.
